=TITLE Gather CSS Plugin for HTML2
=DESCRIPTION Plugin manages the css, either local or remote, provided by other plugins. Adapted from
Collection plugin of same name.

=head1 Useage

This plugin looks at all the namespaces in the B<ProcessedPod> object's plugin-data area and seeks
C<css>, C<add-css> or C<css-link> keys in the other plugin's config.

The plugin's collator callable returns a list of files to be transferred to the C<css_assets> directory.

=head2 Local css files

A C<css> or C<add-css> is interpreted as the name of a local file in the other plugin's directory.

A C<css> key means the contents of the file will be concatenated and placed in a single file
called by the key C<mode-name> in the B<ProcessedPod>'s plugin data area.

A C<add-css> key means the file will be copied directly to the assets subdirectory under the
output directory.

=head2 Remote css

A C<css-link> key's value is the url for a stylesheet.

A template is generated so the the css is served with the output contents.

When a C<css-link> key is included in the config of another plugin, eg ｢some reference string｣, it is included as
C< <link rel=\"stylesheet\" $_ /> >, with C<$_> being the value I<some reference string>.

=head1 Provides

=item a callable that interogates the C<ProcessedPod> object it is passed and find
add-css/css/css-link keys.
