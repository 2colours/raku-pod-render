Some text after a heading
Some thing to say N<A footnote> in between words.

This isn't a comment and I want to add a footnoteN<next to a word>.

When indexing X<an item|Define an item> another text can be used for the index.

It is possible to index X<hierarchical items|defining,a term>with hierarchical levels.

And then index the X<same place|Same,almost;Place> with different index entries.

But X<|an entry can exist> without the text being marked.

=end pod

say 'hello world';
